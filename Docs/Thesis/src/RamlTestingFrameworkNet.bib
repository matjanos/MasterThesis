Taylor, Principled design of the modern web architecture, ACM Trans. Internet Technol.

We present the design and implementation of two solutions that combine REST-based design and RDF [D. Beckett (Ed.), RDF/XML Syntax Specification (Revised), W3C Recommendation, February 10, 2004] data access: one solution for integrating existing web services and one server-side solution for creating RDF REST services. Both of these solutions enable SPARQL [E. Prud'hommeaux, A.

abstract = {Architectural decisions determine the ability of the implemented system to satisfy functional and quality attribute requirements. The Representational State Transfer (REST) architectural style has been extensively used recently for integrating services and applications. Its adoption to build SOA-based distributed systems brings several benefits, but also poses new challenges and risks. Particularly important among those risks are failures to effectively address quality attribute requirements such as security, reliability, and performance. A proved efficient technique to identify and help mitigate those risks is the architecture evaluation. In this paper we propose an approach, tooling, and guidelines to aid architecture evaluation activities in REST-based systems. These guidelines can be systematically used along with evaluation methods to reason about design considerations and tradeoffs. To demonstrate how the guidelines can help architecture evaluators, we present a proof of concept describing how to use the guidelines in an ATAM (Architecture Tradeoff Analysis Method) evaluation. We also present the results of a survey conducted with industry specialists who have performed architecture evaluations in real world REST-based systems in order to gauge the suitability and utility of the proposed guidelines. Finally, the paper describes a Web tool developed to facilitate the use of the evaluation guidelines.},

abstract = {The World Wide Web has succeeded in the large part because its$\backslash$nsoftware architecture has been designed to meet the needs of an$\backslash$nInternet-scale distributed hypermedia system. The modern Web$\backslash$narchitecture emphasizes scalability of component interactions,$\backslash$ngenerality of interfaces, independent deployment of components, and$\backslash$nintermediary components to reduce interaction latency, enforce security,$\backslash$nand encapsulate legacy systems. We introduce the Representational State$\backslash$nTransfer (REST) architectural style, developed as an abstract model of$\backslash$nthe Web architecture to guide our redesign and definition of the$\backslash$nHypertext Transfer Protocol and Uniform Resource Identifiers. We$\backslash$ndescribe the software engineering principles guiding REST and the$\backslash$ninteraction constraints chosen to retain those principles, contrasting$\backslash$nthem to the constraints of other architectural styles. We then compare$\backslash$nthe abstract model to the currently deployed Web architecture in order$\backslash$nto elicit mismatches between the existing protocols and the applications$\backslash$nthey are intended to support},

The need for continuous integration of developed and/or modified microservices in the existing system requires a comprehensive validation of individual microservices and their co-operation as an ensemble with other microservices. In this paper, we would provide an analysis of existing methods of cloud applications testing and identify features that are specific to the microservice architecture. Based on this analysis, we will try to propose a validation methodology of the microservice systems.},

  abstract = {Abstract The number of measurement-based embedded systems increases continuously in automotive, avionic, defense, and communication industries. In order to ensure the system’s compliance with requirements, adequate solutions for functional testing are needed. The paper describes an original approach for the functional validation of measurement-based complex control systems. The main focus is on the automatic generation of realistic continuous data sets (test stimuli) within the operational ranges of the measurement system under test, by applying enhanced statistical techniques, which are able to reproduce both timing and data dependencies. A thorough case study using an air fuel ratio control system from the automotive domain is performed to assess the approach. Results indicate that the proposed method is suitable for automated functional testing of embedded control systems within a Software-in-the-Loop test environment. },
