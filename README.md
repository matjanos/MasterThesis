Rest testing framework is a tool for generating unit tests for REST API, based on extended specification in  [RAML](http://raml.org/). This tool encourage to keep consistent and fine-documented REST API and helps to maintain high level of quality in systems that are based on REST communication. Growing popularity of [Microservices](http://martinfowler.com/articles/microservices.html) was an impulse for creating such tool.
